# Tiny Http Server

A tiny http server that is especially suitable for low resource devices.

I use it to run my lightweight sites on my VPS and low resource iot board.  

multi-thread, fast and safe enough for general site.  

build:  
`make`

then edit your `host.conf` if you need to run multi-sites with different domains.

usage example:  
`./tiny_server 80  `
